I am a Staff Data Scientist at [Walmart Labs](https://www.walmartlabs.com), Sunnyvale, CA. I develop machine learning and computer vision based solutions for content enrichment in the e-commerce domain. Earlier I worked as a Research and Development Engineer in the Department of [Computational Imaging at Intel Corporation](http://download.intel.com/pressroom/kits/research/computational_litho_poster.pdf). 

I graduated from the Ohio State University, Columbus, OH with a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering Department in 2013. My PhD research and earlier work focused on exploratory analysis of large-scale data from various scientific domains

I worked as summer research interns at Argonne National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratories.
